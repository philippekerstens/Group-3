# Group-3
## Project Focus
### Our group topic is Hospital Bed Availability, something that we chose because of its importance in the face of this Covid Pandemic, especially in regards to the difficulty of the early weeks of the pandemic where medical supplies were lacking, and there were difficulties in finding beds in hospitals to deal with the surge in patients.
### It is this projects intention to compile a self-updating database of which it can be utilized by hospitals and governments on the local, state, and national level in keeping track of hospital bed availability as well as preventing overflow and being able to have oversight over vast regions to better handle emergencies like the pandemic.
### By creating this project database we will be able to not only track availability of hospitals during emergencies anv normal times, but also see which hospitals would need the most resources or assistance, especially with the county data which allows us to consider the per capita ratio of hospital bed availability.
## Why this project
### This project focus was chosen as we wished to choose something relevant to our current times and events, and in regards of covid, we discovered the potential for improving and avoiding these issues in the future, or at least aiding those that wish to avoid such crisises again.

## Questions - 
## Communication Protocols 
### Main communication was done through zoom and slack
### Emails and phone numbers were exchanged as potential fallbacks to cover all bases as a redundancy
## Project Timeline
### Monday 1st
#### Our group as assigned and first gathered on Monday, our members were Sam, David, Dylan, and Philippe
#### Contact information was traded, including emails, phone numbers, and the github repository was created
#### Several Ideas were considered in regards as to our project goals, especially as there was the intention to break new ground
#### Originally there had been several intentions of focusing on sport data in a bid to see if we could calculate a win/loss ratio that could predict the possibilities of victory, howwever there were several problems with this idea as unfortunately much of this data had not only already been combed over by other teamss, but also that much of these datasets were securelly locked behind paywalls
#### A pivot was made to focus on Wildfires in the US as not only was it a growing crisis in our world, but the datasets were publicely provided through government agencies
#### It was ultimatly decided to focus on hospital bed capacity in hospitals and clinics throughout the US as a method to keep track of the ovrall status of availability throughout the American Medical infrastructure
### Wednesday 3rd 
#### We found datasets for use within our project, and began working on both our APIs, our databases, and that machine learning system
### Friday 5th
#### Group meeting was held to discuss how best to meld the two databases we had on hand, however roadblocks were encountered in regards to both 
#### The two datasets differed in that one was updated on a daily baises while the other was updated on a weekly basis
#### Another issue arose in regards to connecting county id and the FIP codes however this was partially resolved with aid of Professor Heather 
### Monday 8th
#### Group discussions and brainstorming was held in regards to problems in the databasess but were able to import them successfully
### Wednesday 10th
### Monday 15th
### Wednesday 17th
#### database updated
