# Group-3
## Project Focus
### Our group topic is Hospital Bed Availability, something that we chose because of its importance in the face of this Covid Pandemic, especially in regards to the difficulty of the early weeks of the pandemic where medical supplies were lacking, and there were difficulties in finding beds in hospitals to deal with the surge in patients.
### It is this projects intention to compile a self-updating database of which it can be utilized by hospitals and governments on the local, state, and national level in keeping track of hospital bed availability as well as preventing overflow and being able to have oversight over vast regions to better handle emergencies like the pandemic.
### By creating this project database we will be able to not only track availability of hospitals during emergencies anv normal times, but also see which hospitals would need the most resources or assistance, especially with the county data which allows us to consider the per capita ratio of hospital bed availability.
## Why this project
### This project focus was chosen as we wished to choose something relevant to our current times and events, and in regards of covid, we discovered the potential for improving and avoiding these issues in the future, or at least aiding those that wish to avoid such crisises again.
